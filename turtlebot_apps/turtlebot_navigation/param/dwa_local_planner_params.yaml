  trans_stopped_vel: 0.1

  # Warning!
  #   do not set min_trans_vel to 0.0 otherwise dwa will always think translational velocities
  #   are non-negligible and small in place rotational velocities will be created.

  max_rot_vel: 5.0  # choose slightly less than the base's capability
  min_rot_vel: 0.4  # this is the min angular velocity when there is negligible translational velocity
  rot_stopped_vel: 0.4

  acc_lim_theta: 2.0

# Goal Tolerance Parameters
  yaw_goal_tolerance: 0.3  # 0.05
  xy_goal_tolerance: 0.15  # 0.10
  # latch_xy_goal_tolerance: false
#这两个参数允许您在达到目标时使TurtleBot或多或少准确。小心：非常低的值可以使机器人在目标周围移动，而不会达到它！

# Trajectory Scoring Parameters
  #这三个参数定义了TurtleBot遵循其全局规划的偏好
  path_distance_bias: 64.0      # 32.0   - weighting for how much it should stick to the global path plan 增加使机器人更紧密地遵循计划，即偏向更符合全局规划的路径
  goal_distance_bias: 24.0      # 24.0   - wighting for how much it should attempt to reach its goal      增加，使机器人轨迹更平滑，更有效率，即偏向更符合本地规划的路径
  occdist_scale: 0.5            # 0.01   - weighting for how much the controller should avoid obstacles   增加使机器人更害怕撞上障碍物

  forward_point_distance: 0.325 # 0.325  - how far along to place an additional scoring point
  stop_time_buffer: 0.2         # 0.2    - amount of time a robot must stop in before colliding for a valid traj.
  scaling_speed: 0.25           # 0.25   - absolute velocity at which to start scaling the robot's footprint
  max_scaling_factor: 0.2       # 0.2    - how much to scale the robot's footprint when at speed.

# Oscillation Prevention Parameters
  oscillation_reset_dist: 0.05  # 0.05   - how far to travel before resetting oscillation flags
